\section{Improvements}
If we look at table~\ref{tab:assemb-table} and assume that $\mathbb{S}_1$ and $\mathbb{S}_2$ could have had two additional cells, then a total of 22 \BHSCâ€™s should have been assembled. Out of these 22 possible cells only 5 demonstrated basic functionality. If we want to think about how we can improve our solar cells then we have to discuss how the assembly process can be improved.

\subsection{Tools for the assembly}
When performing any manipulation on a set, we used a pair of tweezers to fixate it. We are certain that the tweezers are a great tool for this application. But when it comes to moving a set of cells from one table to the other this can quickly lead to a situation that accured with $\mathbb{S}_4$ where we accidentally dropped it. The pair of tweezers had to be bent to fit the width of the glass substrate and subsequently holding the substrate under tension ,gives rise to the tweezers snapping together.
