%\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}
%The theoretical model for a photo generated current with a single diode, taking serial $R_s$ and shunt $R_{sh}$ resistances into account predicts the current to have the following implicit shape.\cite{source10}
%
%\begin{align}
%	I\left(1+\frac{R_s}{R_{sh}}\right)-\frac{U}{R_{sh}} = I_s\exp\left(\frac{e(U-I R_s)}{n k_B T}-1\right)-I_{ph}
%\end{align}
%
%Here the photogenerated current is $I_{ph}$ and the saturation current under reverse bias $I_s$, as in the current at which point the current is invariant to an increase of the voltage. $e$ is the elementary charge, $k_B$ the Boltzmann-constant, $T$ the temperature and $n$ is the ideality factor describing how well the cell can be described with the ideal diode equation, being 1 if it's ideal. The shunt resistance relates to parasitic currents moving directly between the electrodes\cite{source11}.

None of the sets we produced are in the realm of what most publications who study P3HT:PCBM-based \BHSC s reach in terms of power conversion efficiency of between 3\% and 4\% let alone what can be reached, which goes above 6.5\%\cite{source13}. In this section we will look at the parameters of the cells and their intensity dependence and try to explain why they behave in the way that they do.\mypar

The first set $\mathbb{S}_1$ is the only set for which if the intensity of the light irradiating the first set $\mathbb{S}_1$ decreases, so does its fill factor. Such a behavior could be due to a higher level of impurities in the cell, as it was exposed to air at room conditions for several days.
