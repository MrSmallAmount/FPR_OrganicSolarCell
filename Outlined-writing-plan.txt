OUTLINE for the report

EXCLUDING THE INTRODUCTION WE WON'T USE THE LAME TITLES FOR THE SECTIONS
    --> think of nice titles for each logical section

Introduction
    -- setting the scene for the work we did

Materials and Methods
    -- Building the organic solar cells
        - BIG FUCKING TABLE of each prepped slide
        - Cleaning process
        - Spin coating process and annealing
        - process of thermal vacuum evaporation
        - calibration of the SOL-device with Laser Point Plast Photodiode
        - calibration of the SOL-device with ReRa Si-cell

Evaluating
    -- Plotting the important I_V curves where we have data to do so
        - showing the dependence on light intensity
        - showing the visualization of the important characteristics
    STUFF PATRICKS WANTS TO SEE (trying to do it where we can do it)
    -- power conversion efficiency in dependence of the power density
    -- stromdichte in abh√§ngigkeit von der photon density

Discussion
    -- calibration done right?
    -- slow and careful at unimportant steps but too fast at VERY important steps (positioning in the vacuum chamber, getting the right tool for handling the prepared slides)
    -- impurities
        - too fast when increasing the power when thermal evaporating
        - outgasing of filament in the vacuum chamber when thermal evaporation
        - touching by hand
        - dropping because insufficient tools
        - residues of soap in the beakers when sonicating

Improvements
    -- better safety (inhaling chemicals, looking into the SOL)
    -- having a clean working enviroment
        - TIDY THE FUCKING LAB
    -- using the right tools for picking up the slides
    -- designated tasks for each experimentor
        - training in handling the slides and syringes will yield better results
