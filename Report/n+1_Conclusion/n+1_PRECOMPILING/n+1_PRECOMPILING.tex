\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

While assembling the bulk heterojunction solar cells we learned a lot about the chemicals necessarily involved in preparing an organic solar cell of modern architecture. We learned how important it is to be critical about every step involved in the process and at the same time to not loose the big picture. We also learned about how active this area of research is and how to sort out helpful information. \mypar
We can conclude that while preparing solar cells special attention to detail has to be made in order to produce cells of sufficient or any functionality.
