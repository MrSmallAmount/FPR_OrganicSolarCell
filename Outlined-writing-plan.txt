OUTLINE for the report

EXCLUDING THE INTRODUCTION WE WON'T USE THE LAME TITLES FOR THE SECTIONS
    --> think of nice titles for each logical section

Introduction
    -- setting the scene for the work we did

Materials and Methods
    -- Building the organic solar cells
        - BIG FUCKING TABLE of each prepped slide
        - Cleaning process
        - Spin coating process and annealing
        - process of thermal vacuum evaporation
        - calibration of the SOL-device with Laser Point Plast Photodiode
        - calibration of the SOL-device with ReRa Si-cell

Evaluating
    -- Plotting the important I_V curves where we have data to do so
        - showing the dependence on light intensity
        - showing the visualization of the important characteristics
    STUFF PATRICKS WANTS TO SEE (trying to do it where we can do it)
    -- power conversion efficiency in dependence of the power density
    -- stromdichte in abh√§ngigkeit von der photon density

Discussion
    -- calibration done right?
    -- slow and careful at unimportant steps but too fast at VERY important steps (positioning in the vacuum chamber, getting the right tool for handling the prepared slides)
    -- impurities
        - too fast when increasing the power when thermal evaporating
        - outgasing of filament in the vacuum chamber when thermal evaporation
        - touching by hand
        - dropping because insufficient tools
        - residues of soap in the beakers when sonicating
    -- Galinstan will yeet off 

Improvements
    -- better safety (inhaling chemicals, looking into the SOL)
    -- having a clean working enviroment
        - TIDY THE FUCKING LAB
    -- using the right tools for picking up the slides
    -- designated tasks for each experimentor
        - training in handling the slides and syringes will yield better results
    -- estimate statistical error through the mean deviation from linear regression between two points per distance and slope










1. Assembly




2.      Characterization of I-U-curves
adjawnfuijabfubfsiufbsufia <== Calibration
                            <== What device do we use for the light


2.1     Photodiode calibration
asjbdajubsdubjasdajsda <== How do the filters effect the power output etc..

2.2     Verification via inorganic solar cell
asnfkidngnedrjgnjregswe <== Does the reference cell yield the given parameters in the manual for our, now calibrated, ABET device?


2.3     Calculation of cell parameters

I-U curves -> with A j-U curves -> meaning over cells in each OSC slide

j_sc and V_oc via interpolation (explanation with errors)

==> tables for achieved parameters

==> Filter0, Filter2, Filter 4, Dark for:   -OSC1
                                            -OSC3
                                            -OSC5
