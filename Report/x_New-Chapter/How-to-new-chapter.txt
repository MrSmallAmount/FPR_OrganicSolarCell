STEP 0:
Make a copy of this folder to start working

STEP 1:
Rename the x_New-Chapter folder, where x is the ToC number of the chapter

STEP 2:
Replace x (ToC number) in the contained folders and .tex-files (x_Pictures, x_PRECOMPILING, x_PRECOMPILING.tex, x_rawtext.tex)

STEP 3:
In "x_PRECOMPILING.tex" replace x in "generate=x_rawtext.tex"

STEP 4:
Compile for testing.

STEP 5:
Go into the n+2_Master folder and paste a new \import line into the master document (FPR_labcourse) after "WE BEGIN TO WRITE HERE"

TIP:
To see changes you wrote in x_PRECOMPILING.tex you have to compile which creates the x_rawtext.tex that ACTUALLY gets imported in n+2_Master
