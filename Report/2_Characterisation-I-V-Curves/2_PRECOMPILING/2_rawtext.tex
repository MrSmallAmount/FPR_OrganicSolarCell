\section{Characterization of the I-V-Curves}

In order to characterize the manufactured solar cells, we connected them to a multimeter and put them on top of a solar simulator. The simulator utilizes the AM 1.5 global reference spectrum and is also outfitted with 5 different filters to dim the light. Using the multimeter we applied a sequence of voltages to the cell and measured the current that was produced as a result. This was done at different levels of intensity of the light and in the dark.\\
In order to get an accurate measure for the intensity with which the solar simulator irradiated the cells, we measured the I-V-curves of an inorganic solar cell whose efficiency had already been determined, using the different filters.
